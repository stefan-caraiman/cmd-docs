# Basic Usage

Find files and directories matching a given name:
    find <searchdir> -name <name>


# By Name

Search `/searchdir` for files and directories named `file.txt`:
    find ./searchdir -name file.txt


## Case Insensitive

Use `-iname` for case insensitive name searching:
    $ find ./searchdir -iname file.txt
    ./searchdir/file.txt
    ./searchdir/bar/FiLe.TxT


## Wildcards

Wildcards are supported with quotes.

Find files starting with `prefix`:
    $ find ./searchdir -name "prefix*"
    ./searchdir/prefix.txt
    ./searchdir/prefixAndMore.txt


# By Type

## Files only

Will find files (`-type f`) but not directories named `foo`:
    find ./searchdir -type f foo


## Directories and Folders

List only directories by specifying `-type d`:
    $ find ./searchdir -type d -name 'directory'
    ./searchdir/directory


# Size

Use the `-size` flag followed by a number and a unit. Without a unit it matches
blocks.

Find entries exactly two bytes (`-size 2c`). `c` stands for character:
    find ./searchdir -size 2c

Find files exactly 2 kilobytes (`-size 2k`):
    find ./searchdir -size 2k

Find files exactly 2 megabytes (`-size 2M`):
    find ./searchdir -size 2M


## Ranges

Prefix a size with `+` for >= that value and `-` for <= that value.

Find files greater than 5k (`-size +5k`):
    find /dir/to/search +5k

Find files less than 5k (`-size -5k`):
    find /dir/to/search -5k


# Time

Files can also be filtered based on the last time they were changed, modified,
and accessed.

`-ctime` refers to the last time the inode or file was changed, which includes
updating file attributes like owner or permissions as well as file
modifications.

`-mtime` refers to the last time a file was modified.

`-atime` refers to the last time a file was accessed, including by other
command line tools.

Arguments to these flags can be in seconds (`s`), minutes (`m`), hours (`h`),
days (`d`), or weeks (`w`). Preceding an argument with `+` will return files
greater than the condition, while `-` will return files less than the
condition.

Find files modified (`-mtime`) less than 20 minutes (`-20m`) ago:
    find /searchdir -mtime -20m

Find files last accessed (`-atime`) more than 2 weeks (`+2w`) ago:
    find /searchdir -atime -w2

Alternatively, you can return files that have been modified more recently than
another file with `-newer`:
    find /searchdir -newer other.txt


# Depth

Find files and directories only two levels deep (`-depth 2` or `-d 2`):
    $ find ./one -depth 2
    ./one/two
    ./one/foo.txt

Find only files (`-type f`) >= two levels (`-mindepth 2`) and <= three levels
(`-maxdepth 3`) deep:
    $ find ./one -type f -mindepth 2 -maxdepth 3
    ./one/twoLevels.txt
    ./one/two/threeLevels.txt


# Boolean Operators

Flags are ANDed by default, but can also achieve OR and NOT functionality.

## AND

List files greater bigger than 500k (`+500k`) and named `bigFile.txt`
(`-name bigFile.txt`). These two commands are equivalent:
    $ find ./searchdir -size +500k -name bigFile.txt
    $ find ./searchdir -size +500k -and -name bigFile.txt

## OR

List files bigger than 500k (`+500k`) or those that are named `smallFile.txt`
(`-or -name smallFile.txt`):
    find ./searchdir -size +500k -or -name smallFile.txt

## NOT

List files bigger than 50 megabytes (`-size +50M`) that are not named
`unwanted.txt` (`-not -name unwanted.txt`):
    find ./searchdir -size +50M ! -name unwanted.txt


# Execute Commands on Results

You can execute a command on all matched files using the `-exec` option. The
string `{}` will be replaced with the name of the matched file, and the command
must be terminated with an escaped semicolon (`\;`).

## Change Permissions

Give all files (`-type f`) 755 permissions (`-exec chmod 755 '{}' \;`):
    find ./searchdir -type f -exec chmod 755 '{}' \;

## Delete

Deleting files has its own flag. Find all files (`-type f`) ending with a tilde
(`-name '*~'`) and remove them (`-delete`):
    find ./searchdir -type f -name '*~' -delete
